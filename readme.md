# Project 140 - Improve the effectiveness of Design Meetings in Architecture, Engineering and Construction Industries Using Smartphone Augmented Reality

##### Sahil Kapadia - Harry Li - 2020

### Prerequisites

This project was made on Unity 2019.3.0, which will be required to run the prototype. The latest scene is called UnityARProject(Phase9)(vuforia) and the scene can be located in Assets>vuforia, or can be searched. It's advised to install this Unity Version via Unity Hub, and install the android or ios modules from the additional modules section in unity hub.

## Running the project

The project can either be run from Unity Hub or from Unity itself. It would be useful to watch some tutorial on how to use unity, and how to install the appropriate vuforia packages.


## Folder Structure

The folders 'Literature Review', 'Mid-year report', 'Poster', 'Presentation', and 'Report' contain the submissions of each student. The folder 'Prototype' contains the final version of the prototype created for this project.Finally the folder 'User Trials' is composed of 3 further folders. The 'Drawings and image targets' Folder contains the drawings provided in the experiment, as well as the two image targets that are used for the tutorial and the experiment. The 'Ethics' Folder contrains the information submitted to the Ethics Board. The 'Results' Folder contains raw data and the transformed data. A comprehensive list of the files in this repository is included below.
